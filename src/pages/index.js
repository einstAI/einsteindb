              MilevaDB supports the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data type, which is useful for storing semi-structured data. We first use cost as feedback to train the model and then switch to latency as feedback for fine-tuning. 
              Different from that only uses latency as feedback, we treat these two feedback as two separate tasks but sharing one common representation, through multi-task learning.

                A view acts as a virtual table, whose schema is defined by the SELECT statement that creates the view. 
                 By doing so, the model can learn cost and latency together, by setting the objective loss function as a weighted sum of these two problems.
