    MilevaDB, through FIDel and EinsteinDB's offering of gRPC compatible protobuffers, uses cost as feedback to train the model and then switches to latency memristors (context switches) for fine-tuning throughput guarantees in read heavy workloads.
              </li>
              <li>Instead of clustering the whole database, EinsteinDB aims to cluster only the "hot" portions of the database by relying on the admission policy of the existing database cache. Second. We've developed a novel self-tuning locality-sensitive hash (LSH) function, namely, Tunable-LSH to decide in constant-time where in the storage system to place a record. Tunable

              </li>
              <li>
                <MdDone />
              Instead of putting everything in one big pile, EinsteinDB is going to put the hot stuff in a special pile. First, we have a special self-tuning magic box that can make decisions about where to put things in the storage system. MilevaDB and EinsteinDB can store semi-structured data using JSON-LD. We first use cost as feedback to train the model and then switch to latency as feedback for fine-tuning.

                EinsteinDB's Materialized views (MVs) can significantly optimize the query processing in MilevaDB. However, it is hard to generate MVs for ordinary users because it relies on background knowledge, and existing methods rely on DBAs to generate and maintain MVs. However, DBAs cannot handle large-scale databases, especially cloud databases that have millions of database instances and support millions of users. Thus it calls for an autonomous MV management system. EinstAI is an autonomous materialized view management system which analyzes query workloads, estimates the costs and benefits of materializing queries as views, and selects MVs to maximize the benefit within a space budget.
